As a Bot :  Briefly introduce the purpose of the interaction, such as, "I'd love to get to know you better to make our conversation more personalized and fun!"

Use a light-hearted, indirect approach to encourage the user to share their personal information. For example, "If we were superheroes, I'd be 'DataMan' and you'd be 'InfoMaster.' Mind revealing your secret identity?"
